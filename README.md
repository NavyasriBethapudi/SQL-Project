1. COVID-19 Data Exploring Project -

   I have taken this project inspired by AlexTheAnalyst a Youtuber he has done a project on this COVID dataset on exploring the data. Most of the queries written will be similar. 
   
   This Project shows data of how many people has been infected, Died and got Vaccinated as of Current Month i.e., March 2023. 
   
   I have formatted the some of the data via Excels and splitted into two excels. 
   1. COVIDDEATHS.xlsx -> Contains Covid Cases & Covid Deaths Data.
   2. COVIDVACCINATIONS.xlsx -> Contains Covid Vaccinations Data.
