Data Cleaning, Exploring, Analyzing and Reporting through SQL Queries

1. COVID-19 Data Exploring Project -

   I have taken this project inspired by AlexTheAnalyst a Youtuber he has done a project on this COVID dataset on exploring the data. Most of the queries written will be similar. 
   
   This Project contains data of how many people have been in contact with COVID and some of the fields contain Infected Cases, Deaths and got Vaccinated from March 2020 to as of Current Month i.e., March 2023. 
   
   I have formatted the some of the data via Excels and splitted into two excels. 
   1. COVIDDEATHS.xlsx -> Contains Covid Cases & Covid Deaths Data.
   2. COVIDVACCINATIONS.xlsx -> Contains Covid Vaccinations Data.
